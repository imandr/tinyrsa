You are Fiona, a princess living in the kingdom of Larion. You wake up in a big feather bed and hear clamoring outside your door. A knight rushes in to tell you that the palace has been attacked by evil creatures and that you must get to it as soon as possible. You leave your room, down the hall and through the palace of riches and decadence.
Prince Charming Shrek arrives and tells you both that the Ogre that you saw a couple days ago in the forest has attacked the kingdom again. He says that he is determined to save the kingdom no matter what the cost.
The Donkey jumps out of the woods, carrying the evil Ogre Harold on his back. The Ogre has broken free of the chain that tied him to the Donkey. He throws the dead Donkey on the ground and swears at the Donkeys corpse.
The Wolf arrives and tells you both to leave.
Or else he will eat the Red Hood, her grandma and all of her 3 piglets.
"What about my piggy bank?" the Grandma asks sweetly.
The Grumpy Old Elf runs away and hides, promising to return when he isgood and ready.
Evil Ogre Harold replies that Grandma's piggy bank will have to be converted to Bitcoins and that Shrek will have to pay the currency conversion fee and any capital gains taxes the Grandma earns when she finally liquidates her tiny portfolio. Shrek protests violently.
"This is all your fault!" he shouts at the hideous green ogre. "If it wasn't for you, I would have been king by now. I would have married Fiona and everything would be perfect.
Grandma takes Shrek the Charming side and calls her lawyer from the Puss, Boot and Associates law offices to help.  She says that the law is on her side.
"Your highness, I can give you some sound legal advice," the Elf says slyly.
